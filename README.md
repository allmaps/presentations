# Allmaps Presentations


This template should help get you started creating awesome slide decks using [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) with Svelte in Vite.
You can also use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) utility classes to style your slide contents.

## How does it work?
- Your slides are both Svelte components and Reveal.js slides.
- You can have one or more slides (using `<section/>`) within a single Svelte component.
- Create new slides as Svelte components under `src/slides`
- Just import and include your components inside the `src/Presentation.svelte` component
- That's it, you are good to go.

## Configuring Reveal.js
You can customize the `Reveal.js` setup in `src/config.js`.
